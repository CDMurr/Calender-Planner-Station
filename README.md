This web application is a Calendar/Planner, excellent for help, to tackle all of those little things that you need to get done throughout your day. We have designed Calendar-Planner-Station to be the last planner you'll ever need!  Using this application, employees can open the application and see the current date and time. Below that will be all the hours broken down by the hour for the entire working day. As the day moves alongs the hours will be color coated to represent the past, present, and future hours of the day. The user can click on each hour of the day to apply and save a task for that hour, if at any time the user wishes to edit the saved task, they can easily do so and resave the task. This Calendar/Planner is gauranteed to save you tons of time, and allow you to focus on the things that really matter!
